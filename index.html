        <p>	Hi everyone! My name is Sophia Pywowarczuk, and I am
             a student at Northeastern University. I am currently in 
             my 3rd year studying Computer Science and Political 
             Science. I am originally from Tempe, Arizona, but I now
             live in Northern Virginia about 30 minutes from
             Washington, D.C. My favorite food are Ukrainian 
             dumplings, called <i>pierogi</i>. Some of my hobbies include </p>

        <ul>
            <li>reading</li>
            <li>crocheting</li>
            <li>cooking</li>
            <li>musical theater</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Plans for my website</h2>

        <p>
            In the future, I hope to use this website as a planning
             tool with some sort of calendar/planning function. 
             In addition, I would like to use it as a place to 
             share some of my hobbies, including
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>the books I've read recently</li>
            <li>some of my crochet projects</li>
            <li>my favorite recipes</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Reading</h1>

        <p>My favorite genres are Romance, Fantasy, and Mysteries.
            In 2023, I read 38 books, and in 2024, I have a goal 
            to read at least 45 books.</p>
